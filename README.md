# [panic-mode]

It starts from the fact that many of us do not really know what would be the right move in case of emergencies. We want to automate the actions in such scenarios where help reaches the victim as soon as possible.

It was developed in WildHacks Hackathon 2016 at Northwestern University

## what it does

Alerts people when there is a safety risk. Sends notifications to related people once we discover you are not safe. Performs utmost surveillance by pointing the camera to the distress situation and predetermined people will be alerted if any panic or stress situations are discovered using the expressions, objects around and the overall environment.
